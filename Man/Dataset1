Dataset of unique specimen records as defined by unique combinations of scientific name, collection date, collector, and location collected at. These records may be associated with multiple specimens of the same species collected by the same person on the same day at the same location though they will be referred to as specimens within the variable descriptions below. Used for estimating species richness trends and when species were collected over time.

1. Number of variables: 10
2. Number of cases/rows: 6080
3. Variable List:
scientific_name: the scientific name of the specimen
family: the taxonomic family the specimen belongs to
day: the day the specimen was collected on
month: the month the specimen was collected on
year: the year the specimen was collected on
recorded_by: who collected the specimen
decimal_latitude: the latitude where the specimen was collected in decimal format
decimal_longitude: the longitude where the specimen was collected in decimal format
where_obtained_coordinates: whether the decimal coordinates were in the original dataset the record was from or was obtained by using google earth and searching for the collection location
n: the number of specimens that the unique combination of "scientific_name", "day", "month", "year", "recorded_by", "decimal_latitude", "decimal_longitude" corresonds to
